# Polygon Area Calculator

<p>This application will calculate the area of (some) Common polygons:</p>

* Equilateral Triangle
* Square
* Rectangle
  
<p>...and some other polygons like:</p>

* Pentagon
* Hexagon
* Heptagon
* Octogon

# Installation

Maybe, eh. It's not worth it right now.

# Usage

If you do end up compling it yourself, you just need to enter either Triangle, Square, Rectangle or Polygon, and follow the prompt. You'll get an area calculation. It loops so you don't have to keep re-run it every time you want to use it.
